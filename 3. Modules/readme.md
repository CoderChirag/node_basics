# Modules

A **module** is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.

Javascript didn't have this feature up until ES6. It did have ways to protect your code and separate code blocks, but it was a workaround.

So nodejs needed to give us this ability to build code modules. Thus, nodejs implemented something called [CommonJs Modules](./3.1%20CommonJs%20Modules/readme.md).

After the introduction of ES6 [ESModules](./3.2%20ECMASCRIPT%20Modules/readme.md), node js have also supported this.

We'll dive into both types modules in this section ðŸš€.
