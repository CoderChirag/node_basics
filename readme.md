## Getting Started

This awesome nodejs journey would be comprising of different modules each written in a different folder.
In each module, there would be a <span>readme.md</span> which would be the journey of that module.
With that, some modules would also be comprising of source code files depending on the journey.

**Note:** For keeping the repo as beginner freindly, and easy to use, I would be numbering the modules to give an order to read through.
:book: But if you already have some experience with Nodejs, feel free to :mag: explore the modules in any order. :rocket:
